\subsection{Idea}

Christian, Divya, and Spyros are three students who work on a project in Security Systems. The ideal for them is to work together. This means that they need to share their work with each other. This could be realised easily when an internet connection is available, but it is not always possible for them to have access to the internet. In such a case, they need to work offline but in the same time be able to share their progress.
