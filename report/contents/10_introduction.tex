Christian, Divya, and Spyros are three students who work on a project in Security Systems. The ideal for them is to work together. This means that they need to share their work with each other. However, access to the internet is not always given or the internet does not work reliably. Nevertheless, the students need to work effectively by sharing their work --- this means that they should be able to access files that are stored on another computer.

computers are combined in a virtual fs that automatically adds files.

this vfs uses a peer-2-peer scheme in order to automatically add peers to the vfs. 

The proposed solution should be able to work across network boundaries, creating a flexible structure and thus the peer do not have to be physically connected to each other. 

this way, every student does not need to transmit ownership of a file because the file is stored locally on his computer and filesharing is possible with minimal configuration.
