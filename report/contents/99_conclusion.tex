 Scalability: excellent

 Access transparency: good - access control per directory, not per
ﬁle

 Replication: limited à only on read-only ﬁles

 Security: limited à Kerberos authentication protocol used

 Mobility transparency: good

 Location transparency: poor, but not noticeable by users, only by
system administrators

Performance: excellent - dramatically reduced loads on servers. A
server load of 40\% with 18 client nodes versus a load of 100\% for
NFS

Access transparency: excellent - the API is the UNIX system call
interface for both local and remote ﬁles.

Location transparency: not guaranteed but normally achieved -
naming of ﬁlesystems is controlled by client mount operations, but
good location transparency can be ensured by an appropriate
system conﬁguration.

 Mobility transparency: hardly achieved - relocation of ﬁles is not
possible, relocation of ﬁlesystem is possible, but requires updates
to client conﬁgurations.

 Scaling: good - a group of NFS servers can handle very large loads.
For a single server, the performance limit is determined by its load.
Additional servers may be added, so that ﬁlesystems are
subdivided and allocated between them.

 Replication: limited to read-only ﬁle systems. File replication for
updates is achieved with a support of the Sun Network
Information Service (NIS).

 Heterogeneity: good - NFS is implemented for almost every OS
and hardware platform.

 Failure: limited but eﬀective - ﬁle service is suspended if a server
fails. Failure recovery is aided by the simple stateless design.

 Concurrency: limited but adequate for most purposes - when
read-write ﬁles are shared concurrently betweeen clients,
consistency is not perfect.

 Security: hardly achieved - no data is encrypted and UNIX-style
authentication is used. Additionally, it supports Diﬃe-Hellman
and Kerberos authentication mechanisms.

 Performance: good - multiprocessor servers achieve very high
performance, but for a single ﬁlesystem it is not possible to go
beyond the throughput of a multiprocessor server.
