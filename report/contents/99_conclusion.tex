 Scalability: excellent

 Access transparency: good - access control per directory, not per
file

 Replication: limited, only on read-only files

 Security: limited, Kerberos authentication protocol used

 Mobility transparency: good

 Location transparency: poor, but not noticeable by users, only by
system administrators

Performance: excellent - dramatically reduced loads on servers. A
server load of 40\% with 18 client nodes versus a load of 100\% for
NFS

Access transparency: excellent - the API is the UNIX system call
interface for both local and remote files.

Location transparency: not guaranteed but normally achieved -
naming of filesystems is controlled by client mount operations, but
good location transparency can be ensured by an appropriate
system configuration.

 Mobility transparency: hardly achieved - relocation of files is not
possible, relocation of filesystem is possible, but requires updates
to client configurations.

 Scaling: good - a group of NFS servers can handle very large loads.
For a single server, the performance limit is determined by its load.
Additional servers may be added, so that filesystems are
subdivided and allocated between them.

 Replication: limited to read-only file systems. File replication for
updates is achieved with a support of the Sun Network
Information Service (NIS).

 Heterogeneity: good - NFS is implemented for almost every OS
and hardware platform.

 Failure: limited but effective - file service is suspended if a server
fails. Failure recovery is aided by the simple stateless design.

 Concurrency: limited but adequate for most purposes - when
read-write files are shared concurrently between clients,
consistency is not perfect.

 Security: hardly achieved - no data is encrypted and UNIX-style
authentication is used. Additionally, it supports Diffie-Hellman
and Kerberos authentication mechanisms.

 Performance: good - multiprocessor servers achieve very high
performance, but for a single filesystem it is not possible to go
beyond the throughput of a multiprocessor server.
